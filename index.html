			The power of music is in the connection that we
			find with the words and sounds. Many songs have
			had unique meaning to me over-time, but three
			songs stand out among others.

				This was a family favorite to sing while

				When I began to take voice lessons a little
				more seriously this was one of the first
				songs that I sung. It gave me an
				appreciations for songs sung in the past
				that I could still enjoy. I performed the
				piece in a competition and did pretty well.

				My mom wrote "What a Wonder", and sadly, I
				don't have a video of it. She remembers
				coming out of the Nauvoo temple and seeing
				the statue of Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith
				and the words just came to her. This has
				helped me build my own testimony of the
				restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ.
